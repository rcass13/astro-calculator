# Explorot Tarot App
Explorot is a web application that allows you to explore the fascinating world of tarot. With Explorot, you can gain insights into the mystical art of divination and deepen your understanding of tarot cards. The app features various tools and resources to enhance your tarot journey.

## Features
Astrology Tarot Calculator
The Astrology Tarot Calculator enables you to calculate your astrological tarot cards based on your astrological natal chart. There are many places on the web you can calculate your natal chart, and I recommend the Co-Star app for IOS and Android (they also have a web natal chart calculator) as well the Chani App for iPhone (this one is my favorite). Once you have all of your planet placements, simply enter them into the form and find out what cards represent certain astrological placements. By discovering the connection between your birth chart and tarot, you can gain a deeper understanding of how astrology influences the tarot. 

## Personality/Soul Cards
Explore your Personality/Soul Cards, also known as birth cards, with this feature. By understanding the connection between numerology and tarot, you can identify the tarot cards that represent your personality and soul traits. Discover the profound insights hidden within the cards and gain a greater understanding of yourself.

## Tarot Card Meanings
Enhance your tarot readings with the Tarot Card Meanings feature. This feature provides in-depth interpretations and insights into the meanings of all the cards. Filter cards by suit and explore the symbolism and messages behind each card to deepen your connection with the tarot and improve your ability to interpret the cards accurately.
